# Site Analysis

## Obtaining Open Geospatial Data

In order to perform site analysis, it is essential to have geospatial data of the site. Fortunately, these geospatial data are openly available on the data.gov.sg website. Through the portal, we are able to obtain the "Master Plan 2014 Land Use" data. The "Master Plan 2014 Land Use" data contains valuable information such as:

* Geometry of the plots
* Gross Plot Ratio \(GPR\)
* Land Use Type

We can also obtain building footprints from the "Master Plan 2014 Building" data available on the portal. Another data source for obtaining building footprints is the Open Street Map website. There are many other data available on the portal that is useful for design. We encourage students to browse and explore through the data.
